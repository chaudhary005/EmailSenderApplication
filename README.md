**WORKING OF ASSIGNMENT**

This is a simple PHP application which would take the users' email address and then send XKCD comic images via email in every 5 minutes.
It also has **unsubscribe** button if in case user do not want to get the emails.

**MORE ABOUT ASSIGNMENT**

When the user go to the application, the application asks for login, if the user has the account already then he/she can login.
But if the user don't have the account then they have to register by clicking of **Signup**. After filling the details the user will get a verification email on the email account they have given while registering.
This is for safety reason so that no one can register a fake account or use someone else email account.
After the successful registration  the user will start getting emails containing XKCD comic images as an attachment and inline content as well.

**UNSUBSCRIBE**

Unsubscribe link has also been given in every email so that users can stop receiving emails whenever they want. But to unsubscribe the emails they have to login first to confirm their account, so that no any other person can unsubscribe the emails without the account holder's permission.
Also if the user had unsubscribed the emails and now wanted to subscribe again, then they can by just logging into their account and bye clicking **subscibe** link.
The signup and login functionality is used here to increase the safety of the users' account so that no one could mess up with someone others' account without the permission.
